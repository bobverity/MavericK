# MavericK

Here are the raw files that make up the program [MavericK](www.bobverity.com/maverick). These files are distributed under [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), which means you can basically do whatever you want with them as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software/source code.

The Makefile contains all the commands needed to compile the program, meaning you should only need to implement the command "make" on the command line to compile the program. This Makefile uses the g++ compiler under c++11.

Separate branches exist for each released version of the software. Select the branch corresponding to the version you are interested in before downloading files, or alternatively you can see all released versions in the "releases" tab.

To all C++ coders out there - if you can see any obvious efficiency gains that can be had in this code then please drop me an e-mail at maverick.help@bobverity.com and I'll try to include them in the next version of the program. The same goes for any bugs of course!
